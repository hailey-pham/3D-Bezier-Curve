Task 3:
c(i,0) = (0.5 * P(i-1)) + (0.5 * P(i))
c(i,1) = (0.5 * P(i)) + (0.5 * P(i+1))

Task 5:
In both cases points distributed evenly along a circle will still form a circle. This is evident in the
simulation that I have created in this project, and also conceptually. The curve made up of these points
slowly approaches each point, so if the points are uniformly distributed in a circle, the curve will also
form a circular pattern.
