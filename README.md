# 3D Bezier Curve Project

In this project I used OpenGL to create a closed shape rendered with bezier curves in a 3 dimensional space. I created a vertex system that allows the user to modify the position of the control points via the mouse using draw picking. The program calculates the curves between the control points as either subdivision or bezier curves.

For the most significant code the I wrote see the following scripts:
- (../source/main.cpp)
- (../source/PointsObject.cpp)
- (../source/pointsVertexShader.glsl)
