Task 1:
I implemented movement of the Z axis with a toggle as well as a second PointsObject to later view the Z axis.

Task 2:
Using the second points object as well as a new y offset variable in the PointsObject which draws the point
y amount down. Changing the offset makes both points objects visible.

Task 3:
I created the animation using a dot drawn at index i on both PointsObjects, but I did not implement the frenet
frame as I ran out of time and couldn't understand the math. I made an attempt to find the tangent from the
curve formula for the bezier curve so I could get the perpendicular vector which would be the normal vector.
